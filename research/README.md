# SamiLearns Research

This has the research work collected / done for making this system. This is only a subset of the actual work done and relevant notebooks can be found here. Mostly the works is split in following parts:
1. Extraction of continuous distribution for the paragraphs: getting the neural network embedding for the text input
2. Extraction of keywords from the paragraphs: how do we know which parts of the paragraph are important
3. Clustering of information based on these things in the text: merging the continuous and discrete system for clustering the information
4. Selection of relevant content as paragraphs: no two websites are the same and we would like to know which parts are important when scraping the website
